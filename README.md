# bulkcsvinsertion

## SpringBoot 4, Hibernate 4, MySQL 5.7, and java 8

##Main Purposes

###Clustered Data Warehouse

Suppose you are part of a scrum team developing data warehouse for Bloomberg to analyze FX deals. One of customer stories is to import deals details from files into DB. The requested performance is to be able to import the file containing 100,000 records in less than 5 seconds.

Request logic as following :

File format is CSV contains the following fields (Deal Unique Id, From Currency ISO Code "Ordering Currency", To Currency ISO Code, Deal timestamp, Deal Amount in ordering currency).
Validate row structure.
Valid rows should be stored in table/document, with reference to source
 file name .
Invalid rows should be stored into another table/document, with reference to source file name.
The DB contains another table to maintain accumulative count of deals per Ordering Currency "Columns : Currency ISO Code, CountOfDeals ", so upon completion of importing process the system should increase count of deals per currency.
System should not import same file twice.
No rollback allowed, what every rows imported should be saved in DB.

Technical Specs :

Access to DB should be through JPA.
For DB type, you can select between (MySql or MongoDB)
Provide a web interface for uploading files and inquire about results "using filename" following web applications 3 tier architecture. Spring Batch is not allowed.

###Info
Upload multiple file and store into the database and download file 

It's cloud deploy-able (jetty-runner.jar + compiled war file)

For configuration of Spring MVC, it uses Java config instead of xml config.
For Hibernate 4 and MySQL, please modify src/main/resources/application.properties file
Build and run the app in command line environment

###1.Create table in MySQL

Copy the text in src/main/resources/sample/sql.sql and run it to create a table in MySQL (in phpmyadmin or MySQLworkbench or mysql command line environment)

###2.Build package
```
$ mvn package
```
###3.Run jetty-runner
```
$ ./run.sh
or
$ java -jar jetty/jetty-runner-9.2.6.v20141205.jar --port 8090 --log jetty.log target/SpringFileUpload.war
```
Running URL: http://localhost:8099/bulkUpload

**docker image coming soon

#Steps to set up development environment in Eclipse

##After you clone this project from github, run

$ mvn eclipse:eclipse
```
Open Eclipse to import the project
Click top File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects (Choose the folder that you just downloded)
Right click your project, click Properties -> Java Build Path, remove all M2_REPO/***/*** jars (names started with M2_REPO), click OK.
Check if Maven dependencies are setup correctly. Right click your project, click Properties -> Java Build Path-> Libraries, and the Maven Dependencies include all your dependent jar files
Right click pom.xml, click Run as-> Maven clean, then Run as-> Maven Install
